THIS IS THE PROMPT THAT I GAVE TO THE BACKEND AI:
"Good. Now on the admin side, I need a key features section when creating or updating a product. Under specifications section, We will show this key features section. We will have a dropdown as the first, we will select already created keys against a product and then we will give a value to it in the value box next to it. We will be able to add more key features, add more keys too and create their values. This section will be only available after selecting the category because key features depend upon category. Example, I select category as Ram, then we get key features options. I enter key as "Ram Speed", "Ram Size", "Color Type" etc, and then after putting in the values I save. And then in future if I'm adding another product with category as Ram, I will be able to select the keys which were previously created for this category but the values I will have to put anew. This is the whole concept. Later we will be using these key features as dynamic search filters on the search result page. I need APIs for it please. Also create a .md guide for it's integration." 

AND THIS IS THE GUIDE THAT IT CREATED FOR ME:





# Key Features API Guide

Use these APIs to manage category-based key feature filters for products.

Key features are different from plain product specs:
- `category_key_features` are reusable keys for a category, such as `Ram Speed`, `Ram Size`, or `Color Type`.
- `product_key_features` are product-specific values for those keys, such as `3200MHz`, `16GB`, or `RGB`.

All admin endpoints are prefixed with: `/api/v1`

---

## Admin Flow

1. Admin selects a product category.
2. Frontend calls `GET /api/v1/key-features?category_id=<category_id>&is_active=true`.
3. Frontend shows a Key Features section under Specifications.
4. Admin selects existing keys or types new key names.
5. Admin enters a new value for each key.
6. Frontend sends `key_features` with product create/update.

## Key Feature Management

### 1. Create Key Feature
**POST** `/api/v1/key-features`

Creates a reusable key for a category.

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "category_id": "ram-category-id",
  "feature_key": "Ram Speed",
  "display_order": 0,
  "is_active": true
}
```

#### Success Response (201)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Key feature created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "key-feature-id",
    "category_id": "ram-category-id",
    "category_name": "Ram",
    "feature_key": "Ram Speed",
    "display_order": 0,
    "is_active": true,
    "created_at": "2026-05-12T10:30:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-05-12T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Get Key Features
**GET** `/api/v1/key-features`

#### Query Parameters
- `category_id` (UUID, optional) - Filter keys by category
- `is_active` (boolean/string, optional) - Filter active/inactive keys

#### Examples
```
GET /api/v1/key-features
GET /api/v1/key-features?category_id=ram-category-id
GET /api/v1/key-features?category_id=ram-category-id&is_active=true
```

#### Success Response (200)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Key features retrieved successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "key-feature-id",
      "category_id": "ram-category-id",
      "category_name": "Ram",
      "feature_key": "Ram Speed",
      "display_order": 0,
      "is_active": true,
      "created_at": "2026-05-12T10:30:00.000Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-05-12T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

---

### 3. Get Key Feature by ID
**GET** `/api/v1/key-features/:id`

---

### 4. Update Key Feature
**PUT/PATCH** `/api/v1/key-features/:id`

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "feature_key": "Memory Speed",
  "display_order": 1,
  "is_active": true
}
```

---

### 5. Delete Key Feature
**DELETE** `/api/v1/key-features/:id`

Deleting a key also deletes saved values for that key because product values depend on the key.

---

## Product Create/Update Integration

The existing product create/update APIs now accept `key_features`.

- **POST** `/api/v1/products`
- **PUT/PATCH** `/api/v1/products/:id`

Because product APIs use multipart form data, send `key_features` as a JSON string.

### Payload Shape

Use an existing key:
```json
{
  "key_feature_id": "existing-key-feature-id",
  "value": "3200MHz"
}
```

Create/reuse a key inline by name:
```json
{
  "feature_key": "Ram Size",
  "value": "16GB"
}
```

Full `key_features` example:
```json
[
  {
    "key_feature_id": "ram-speed-key-id",
    "value": "3200MHz"
  },
  {
    "feature_key": "Ram Size",
    "value": "16GB"
  },
  {
    "feature_key": "Color Type",
    "value": "RGB"
  }
]
```

### Create Product Example
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/products \
  -F "name=Corsair Vengeance RGB 16GB" \
  -F "category_id=ram-category-id" \
  -F "price=79.99" \
  -F "stock=20" \
  -F "vendor_ids=[\"vendor-id\"]" \
  -F "specs=[\"DDR4\", \"Desktop memory\"]" \
  -F "key_features=[{\"key_feature_id\":\"ram-speed-key-id\",\"value\":\"3200MHz\"},{\"feature_key\":\"Ram Size\",\"value\":\"16GB\"},{\"feature_key\":\"Color Type\",\"value\":\"RGB\"}]" \
  -F "main_image=@/path/to/image.webp"
```

### Update Product Key Features Example
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/v1/products/product-id \
  -F "key_features=[{\"key_feature_id\":\"ram-speed-key-id\",\"value\":\"3600MHz\"},{\"feature_key\":\"Ram Size\",\"value\":\"32GB\"}]"
```

When `key_features` is provided on update, all existing key feature values for that product are replaced with the submitted list.

---

## Product Response

Product list and product detail responses now include `key_features`.

```json
{
  "id": "product-id",
  "name": "Corsair Vengeance RGB 16GB",
  "category_id": "ram-category-id",
  "category_name": "Ram",
  "key_features": [
    {
      "id": "product-key-feature-id",
      "key_feature_id": "ram-speed-key-id",
      "feature_key": "Ram Speed",
      "feature_value": "3200MHz",
      "display_order": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Frontend Notes

- Hide the Key Features section until `category_id` is selected.
- Refetch keys whenever `category_id` changes.
- Existing keys should populate the dropdown from `GET /api/v1/key-features?category_id=<id>&is_active=true`.
- Let admins add a new key by sending `feature_key` in the product payload or by calling `POST /api/v1/key-features` first.
- Values are product-specific, so do not reuse old values from another product.
- If the product category changes, submit key features that belong to the new category.
